Globally, more than 2 billion tons of waste are generated each year, and a significant portion of this ends up in landfills or pollutes our oceans. Sadly, much of this waste is recyclable, but due to improper sorting and lack of awareness, valuable materials are lost, and the environmental impact worsens.")

Using advanced AI models, our platform scans objects to instantly determine if they are recyclable or not, ensuring that waste is sorted correctly at the source. By making recycling easier and more efficient, EcoScan can help reduce the volume of waste entering landfills, conserve natural resources, and lower the overall environmental footprint.

I started this project becuase I was very passionate about waste management when I found out the my home city genereated the most waste per capita in India. Worst of all, there was a huge amounts of trash just outside my community. It lead me to research and start this app where we support more sustainble recyling practices by allowing our scanner to recognize whether or not a household item is recylable. ")
