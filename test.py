            Every day, the world generates millions of tons of waste, and India alone contributes over 277 million tons annually. 
            Globally, more than 2 billion tons of waste are generated each year, and a significant portion of this ends up in landfills or pollutes our oceans. 
            Sadly, much of this waste is recyclable, but due to improper sorting and lack of awareness, valuable materials are lost, and the environmental impact worsens. \n \n

            At EcoScan, we are committed to addressing this issue with cutting-edge technology. Using advanced AI models, our platform scans objects to instantly 
            determine if they are recyclable or not, ensuring that waste is sorted correctly at the source. By making recycling easier and more efficient, EcoScan 
            can help reduce the volume of waste entering landfills, conserve natural resources, and lower the overall environmental footprint. 
            Join us in reducing waste, protecting the environment, and building a cleaner future for generations to come.

    <div style='text-align: center; color: white;'>
        I am a 15-year-old who is currently living in Hyderabad and studying at the International School of Hyderabad. 
        I started this project because I was very passionate about waste management when I found out that my home city generated 
        the most waste per capita in India. Worst of all, there was a huge amount of trash just outside my community. It led me to 
        research and start this app where we support more sustainable recycling practices by allowing our scanner to recognize 
        whether or not a household item is recyclable.

        more sustainable future.
